# Credit Risk Data Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a credit risk dataset, using data from financial loan applications. The goal is to uncover insights related to credit risk, identify key patterns in applicant profiles, and detect potential risk indicators through visualizations and summary statistics.

## 📂 Dataset
- **application_data.csv**: Contains client information (demographics, income, credit history, etc.)

## 🔍 Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and feature formatting.
- **Univariate Analysis**: Distribution and frequency plots of features like income, age, loan amount, etc.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Comparative insights like day-of-week vs. hour of application, age category vs. credit amount.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Correlation analysis between numeric features; heatmaps segmented by default status.
- **Visualization**: Extensive use of Seaborn and Matplotlib for meaningful insights.
- **Credit Risk Profiling**: Identifying patterns and potential risk signals in loan applications.

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## 📊 Sample Visuals
- Histograms and KDE plots for feature distributions
- Boxplots and barplots for bivariate comparisons
- Correlation heatmaps for multivariate relationships
